        <h1>What Is Waffle?</h1>

        <ul>

            <li>
                Well "waffle" is the ability to be able to speak a whole lot of nonsense when it is required. However my
                version of waffle combines with any knowledge I may have on a current topic which allows me to have a
                proper
                conversation about something without even preparing for it.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                This skill also allows me to come up with things that are relevant to topics on the spot which can be a
                real
                life saver when it comes to presentationos and other various speaking activities.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                So if any of you would like to expereince the power and capabilities of waffle contact me via my
                contacts page and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
